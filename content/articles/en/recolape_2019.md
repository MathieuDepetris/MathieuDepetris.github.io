<p style="text-align: justify">
RECOLAPE, Strengthening Regional COoperation in the area of LArge PElagic fisheries data collection, is a European project developed in the framework of the MARE/2016/22 contract and more precisely in relation to Annex III: "Biological data collection for fisheries on highly migratory species". 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
The main objective of this project is to strengthen the cooperation of Member States in the collection of biological data on migratory large pelagic species. The underlying objectives are to provide support for stock assessments on large pelagic species, while at the same time providing advice on the management measures to be applied to associated fisheries.

To carry out these tasks, 6 lines of research have been identified: 

1. Facilitate the evolution of RCM-LPs (Regional Coordination Meeting on Large Pelagic ) into RCG-LPs (Regional Coordination Group on Large Pelagic),
2. propose a regional sampling plan for large pelagics,
3. Develop tools and collection protocols for newly identified data related to FOBs (Floating OBjects),
4. test alternative methods of data collection, especially in cases where traditional methods are inadequate,
5. Develop quality control procedures at regional and national level. For more information on this point take a look <a href="https://github.com/OB7-IRD/dqassess" target="_blank">here</a>,
6. identify points of agreement and/or disagreement that may arise during coordination processes in the field of large pelagic fisheries data collection.
