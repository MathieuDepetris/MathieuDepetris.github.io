ARVAM (Agence pour la Recherche et la Valorisation Marines) is a scientific structure created in 1991 in Reunion Island to act as a relay between research and managers-decision-makers in the field of management and conservation of coastal and marine resources, particularly in the Indian Ocean.

The implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) in the Overseas Departments is facing several questions, especially because of the particularities of the ecosystems which make up these departments. In the case of Reunion Island, studies have highlighted a "chronic" enrichment in nutrient salts on the West coast of the island, leading to the degradation of reef ecosystems.

My work was part of the EUTROLAG programme, initiated at the end of 2010, which aimed to apprehend this nutrient enrichment phenomenon as a whole, in order to enable management measures to be established accordingly. My objective was therefore to define bioindicators, and to assess their relevance with regard to the anthropogenic pressures having the greatest impact on the reef environment.

Descriptive analyses carried out on the hydrological compartment made it possible to construct groups of stations hierarchically based on a terrigenous input gradient. Discriminant analyses (AFD and the new multi-table discrimination method: STATIS-LDA) were applied to the data from the biological compartments (ichthyological, algal and benthic), which revealed 38 variables that made it possible to discriminate stations according to the terrigenous input gradient. Several variables were then selected according to their ecological interest, and will be tested for 5 years within the next WFD management plan (2014-2019). This will eventually enable the development of relevant indicators to quantify the "health status" of coral ecosystems and to undertake actions for the management and protection of these fragile environments.
