Through expertise and consulting activities, VIVAGRI'R's main objectives are to implement pest control solutions using methods that respect the environment, but also to promote and encourage beneficial insect populations.

The first part of my work in this company was first of all to conceive the architecture and design of the website, to allow it to be visible and accessible on the web. The second part was firstly to design a database of the numerous customers, and secondly to allow an interactive and dynamic management of this database (through the creation of a search and modification engine).
