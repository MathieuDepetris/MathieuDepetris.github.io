The Mixed Research Unit in Agro-polymer Engineering and Emerging Technologies (UMR IATE) is a unit made up of teams from INRA, CIRAD, the University of Montpellier II and SupAgro. Its general objective is to contribute to the improvement of knowledge on the functionalities of plant products and their constituents in order to increase their performance for both food and non-food uses.

The emergence of diet-related chronic diseases - obesity, non-insulin-dependent diabetes, cardiovascular disease, some cancers - is becoming a major concern in many developing societies. A veritable epidemic of diseases leading to increased and costly morbidity and early excess mortality in adulthood is therefore set to begin in the coming decades throughout the world. The eradication of nutritional diseases is therefore a public health issue.

Mixed pasta, durum wheat-legume wheat (lentils, beans, peas, split peas or chickpeas) is an intimate blend of two food categories that are highly represented in the Mediterranean diet, whose health benefits have been demonstrated by numerous epidemiological studies. The researchers of the project financed by the National Research Agency "Pastaleg" have demonstrated the influence of the structure of the food on its nutritional qualities and the technological feasibility of incorporating a high proportion (35%) of legumes in a paste. The "cereal-legume" pasta obtained is rich in protein, fibre, vitamins and minerals. They are low in lipids and alpha-galactosides, compounds responsible for flatulence. Appropriate drying of the mixed dough reduces its rapidly available glucose content. The glycemic index of these mixed doughs should be lower than that of the already interesting 100% durum wheat dough.

The objective of this work was therefore to carry out statistical analyses to compare 3 types of pasta, with a view to "selecting" the pasta with the best "beneficial effects/consumer acceptance" ratio.
