## Design of a database on elasmobranches in the French Mediterranean Sea

Created in 2006, the AILERONS association's first objective is to study sharks and rays (elasmobranchs) in French Mediterranean waters for a better knowledge and conservation of the species. It has initiated several projects to this end, notably the devil of the sea project which aims to identify and locate individuals of the Mediterranean devil Mobula mobular within the Mediterranean.

<p style="text-align: justify">
In the Mediterranean Sea, elasmobranchs constitute an important by-catch in fisheries that market bony fish. Few fisheries target sharks, but generally in practice all by-catch is commercialized. The Mediterranean Sea therefore represents a unique model for the implementation of an ecosystem approach to fisheries. There is very little data on sharks in the Mediterranean, and most research is based on the study of dead animals. The main cause is the lack of funding for research at sea. However, it is important to have an overview of the current diversity of elasmobranchs, particularly through public awareness raising and the establishment of public surveys, which can be of significant interest.

The aim of this intership is to show that the setting up of public enquiries, coupled with raising public awareness, can have significant benefits and that they are capable of giving an echo of the current diversity of elasmobranchs.
