Created in 1984, Ifremer contributes, through its work and expertise, to the knowledge of the oceans and their resources, the monitoring of the marine and coastal environment and the sustainable development of maritime activities.

Today, the strengthening of water management regulations requires the determination of the ecological integrity of surface waters. But how can this good ecological status be assessed and achieved? How can the different compartments of these bodies of water be managed and, if necessary, restored?
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
Several approaches have been proposed by the scientific community, such as the DPSIR (Drivers, Pressures, State, Impact, Responses) approach, which allows for the conceptualization of an ecosystem, and which is integrated into the Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) processes recognized as "the most appropriate process for dealing with issues in the long term". But are there examples of such applications? How can these methods, which can be complex, be implemented? And above all, with whom should they be implemented?
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
In order to improve the understanding of these concepts and to provide some answers to these questions, I produced a summary report during a 6-month internship at the Ifremer's Resource Environment Laboratory in Sète. It deals with a lagoon in Languedoc-Roussillon, the Bages-Sigean lagoon, where successive actions and processes made it possible to monitor the "ecological state" and improvement of the state of several of these compartments, particularly with regard to eutrophication. This feedback is part of an integrated management approach and is intended for anyone wishing to see an example of ICZM. It makes it very clear that only the cooperation of all the users of an ecosystem allows its efficient and sustainable management.
